The SPEAK team is hard at work this summer! The incoming leadership team has been hard at work planning our 2018-19 programs. As for me, I decided to *finally* do something about our website. This website is cleaner, snappier, and most importantly doesn't crash quite as often as the old one did ;).<a title="The old bloated website was hosted on a \"rather unstable\" server â€“ it's a wonder it worked at all."><sup>n</sup></a> Expect to see more updates over this summer as we head into the school year!
