title: New website!
author: Kevin Li

The SPEAK team is hard at work this summer! The incoming leadership team¹ has been busy planning our 2018-19 programs. As for me, I decided to *finally* do something about our website. This website is cleaner, snappier, and most importantly doesn't crash quite as often as the old one did ;).² Expect to see more updates over this summer as we head into the school year!

¹Amy Huang, Meghna Mallapan, and Maddie Kahl are the wonderful folks leading SPEAK this fall!<br />
²The old bloated website was hosted on a "rather unstable" server – it's a wonder it worked at all.
