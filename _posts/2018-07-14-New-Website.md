The SPEAK team is hard at work this summer! The incoming leadership team<sup>1</sup> has been hard at work planning our 2018-19 programs. As for me, I decided to *finally* do something about our website. This website is cleaner, snappier, and most importantly doesn't crash quite as often as the old one did ;).<sup>2</sup> Expect to see more updates over this summer as we head into the school year!

<sup>1</sup>Amy Huang, Meghna Mallapan, and Maddie Kahl are the wonderful folks leading SPEAK this fall!
<br /><sup>2</sup>The old bloated website was hosted on a "rather unstable" server â€“ it's a wonder it worked at all.
